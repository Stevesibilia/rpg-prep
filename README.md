# rpg-prep

Pre-session toolkit for tabletop RPG game masters, distributed as Claude Code skills.

The repository is the `stevesibilia` plugin marketplace and ships two plugins:

- `rpg-prep`: seven RPG skills.
- `essentials`: general-purpose skills for any task. Today it holds `scrittura-italiana`, which every RPG skill applies, so `rpg-prep` declares `essentials` as a dependency.

Eight skills:

| Skill                    | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `enhanced-avventure-rpg` | Session prep as situations, never PC scripts, in an Italian document built to be looked up at the table: at-a-glance block, clock, self-contained scenes, clue tracker (three clues per revelation), stat blocks, and `visual:`/`mood:` in an appendix. Ships `scripts/controlla.py` to check the output                                                           |
| `revisione-avventura`    | Adversarial review of an adventure or a campaign: logic and causality, clue paths and scene reachability, the golden rule, pacing, and four simulated tables (methodical, impatient, lateral, uninterested). Verifies each finding, reports in the chat with severity and root cause, then brainstorms fixes one question at a time. Does not rewrite the document |
| `campagna-rpg`           | Campaign and arc story design, the layer above a session: premise, world truths, fronts with clocks, factions, PC hooks, arcs as functions, possible endings, thread tracker. Writes a Joplin note «Campagna: <nome>» that `enhanced-avventure-rpg` reads. Ships `scripts/controlla.py`                                                                            |
| `cronaca-di-sessione`    | Turns a session recap into an in-world chronicle in the style of medieval travel accounts, with a chronicler fitted to the milieu                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `scrittura-italiana`     | In `essentials`. Italian writing rules applied by every other skill: no em or en dash, Italian punctuation and quotes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `suno-prompt-creator`    | General-purpose Suno prompts: songs, themes, jingles, lyrics with structure tags                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `midjourney-prompts`     | Scene/NPC → ready-to-paste Midjourney prompts (v8.1/v7 aware), campaign style consistency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `suno-prompts`           | Scene mood → ready-to-paste Suno prompts (v5.5), session cue types, campaign sonic identity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The skills chain: `campagna-rpg` plans the campaign in a Joplin note; `enhanced-avventure-rpg` reads that note to prepare each session and emits `visual:` and `mood:` fields per scene; `midjourney-prompts` and `suno-prompts` consume them.

## Install

The repository is a Claude plugin marketplace. On claude.ai, the desktop app or Cowork: **Customize → Plugins → Add marketplace**, enter `Stevesibilia/rpg-prep`, install `essentials` and `rpg-prep`, turn on **Sync automatically**. In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add Stevesibilia/rpg-prep
/plugin install rpg-prep@stevesibilia
```

Claude Code installs `essentials` with `rpg-prep`, because `rpg-prep` depends on it.

[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) has the details and a zip fallback for claude.ai.
